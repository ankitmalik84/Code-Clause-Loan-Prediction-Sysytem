CodeClause Data Science Internship Task 1 - Loan Prediction System
I am excited to share that I have successfully completed the CodeClause Data Science Internship Task 1, which involved building a Loan Prediction System. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience and learn new skills in data analysis and machine learning.

Project Overview
For this project, I used Python and the scikit-learn library to develop a Loan Prediction System that accurately predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to be approved or rejected based on their credit score, income, employment status, and loan amount. The project involved several steps, including data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.

Data Preprocessing
The first step was to preprocess the loan dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. This step is critical as it ensures that the data is clean and suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Model Selection
Next, I divided the dataset into training and testing sets and employed two machine learning algorithms - Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier - to construct predictive models. Both models are popular and effective for classification tasks, and scikit-learn provides a straightforward implementation of these algorithms.

Model Evaluation
To evaluate the models' performance, I used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics helped me to determine the models' effectiveness in correctly predicting loan approval or rejection. I also fine-tuned the models using hyperparameter tuning to improve their performance further.

Results
The Loan Prediction System achieved an accuracy of 80% using the decision tree classifier and 82% using the random forest classifier. This means that the system was able to correctly predict loan approval or rejection for eight out of ten loan applications using the decision tree classifier and eight point two out of ten loan applications using the random forest classifier. Moreover, the system was able to identify the essential factors that influence loan approval or rejection, such as credit score, income, and loan amount.

Conclusion
Overall, the CodeClause Data Science Internship Task 1 was a valuable learning experience that provided me with practical skills in data analysis and machine learning. I am grateful to the CodeClause team for providing me with this opportunity, and I look forward to applying these skills to solve real-world problems
